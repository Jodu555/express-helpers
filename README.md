A Little npm library to help with authentication 404 middlewares and other stuff

## ToDo

- [ ] On Login or register if i change the user object it does not affect the tokens map
  - [ ] store in the tokens map only a user UUID to then reference the db from that UUID (to have the latest changes)
- [x] Store the authtokens in a database
